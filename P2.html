			<p>Saft og Suse is a hobby group for apple pressing consisting of Torborg Galteland and Jørgen Stenersen as well as a rotating cast of friends. The main purpose of the website will be to act as a wiki of sorts where they can collect and share their knowledge about how to make your own apple juice. </p>
			<p>Another aim of the website is to make others aware of the group’s activities. Finally, Saft og Suse hopes the website will help inspire new apple pressers to press on with their hobby.
