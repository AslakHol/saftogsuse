# Changes
This is a changelog for saftogsuse.
It will outline changes we've made from the original design and plans.


## Directory structure and naming scheme
We've also decided to change the HTML files to have Norwegian names.
Since the website will be in Norwegian it makes more sense for the final
URLs to be in that language.

Homepage.html has been renamed to index.html so that visitors to saftogsuse.no
will be redirected correctly.

We've decided to include a separate css file to accommodate the index page
which will have a radically different design.
Because of this the main css file has been renamed to main.css and both have
been moved into a separate css folder.   

## Fonts
Some fonts and font sizes have changed after discussions with the client.

Lucida Sans Unicode has been removed from h2, it was added by a mistake.
